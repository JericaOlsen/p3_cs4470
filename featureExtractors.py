Feature extractors for Pacman game states.

This module provides feature extractors that convert game states into feature vectors
for use in reinforcement learning and machine learning algorithms. The extractors
transform raw game states into meaningful numeric features that capture important
aspects of the game state. Key extractors include:

- IdentityExtractor: Basic state-action pair features for direct state representation
- CoordinateExtractor: Position and action based features for spatial reasoning
- SimpleExtractor: Basic reflex features like food and ghost distances for reactive behavior

Features are returned as Counter objects mapping feature names to numeric values.
The features can be used to train reinforcement learning agents or other ML models.

Most code originally by Dan Klein and John Denero for CS188 at UC Berkeley.
Some code from LiveWires Pacman implementation, used with permission.
