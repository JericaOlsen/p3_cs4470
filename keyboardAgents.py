"""
Keyboard-controlled agents for Pacman.

This module provides agent classes that can be controlled via keyboard input,
allowing for manual control of Pacman during gameplay. The main class is
KeyboardAgent which maps WASD and arrow keys to movement directions.

Key mappings:
- W/Up Arrow: Move North
- A/Left Arrow: Move West
- S/Down Arrow: Move South  
- D/Right Arrow: Move East
- Q: Stop movement

The agents handle keyboard input processing and legal move validation to ensure
valid actions are taken based on user input.
