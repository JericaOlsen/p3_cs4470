"""
Ghost agents for Pacman game.

This module provides ghost agent implementations for the Pacman game. It includes:
- Base GhostAgent class defining core ghost behavior
- RandomGhost that moves randomly
- DirectionalGhost that prefers certain directions
- Scared ghost behavior when Pacman has power pellets

The ghosts use probability distributions to select actions and can be:
- Configured with different movement strategies
- Made to behave differently when scared
- Given different personalities through weights
- Made to work in both classic and capture modes

Most code originally by Dan Klein and John Denero for CS188 at UC Berkeley.
Some code from LiveWires Pacman implementation, used with permission.

Python Version: 3.13
Last Modified: 24 Nov 2024
Modified by: George Rudolph

Changes:
- Added comprehensive module docstring
- Added type hints throughout module
- Added detailed ghost configuration options
- Added Python version compatibility note
- Added last modified date and modifier
- Verified Python 3.13 compatibility
