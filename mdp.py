"""
Markov Decision Process (MDP) abstract base class.

This module defines the core interface for Markov Decision Process environments.
An MDP consists of:
- States: The possible configurations of the environment
- Actions: What can be done in each state 
- Transitions: How actions change the state (with probabilities)
- Rewards: Numeric feedback for state-action-state transitions

The MDP interface is used by reinforcement learning and planning algorithms
to interact with environments in a standard way.
