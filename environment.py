"""
Environment abstraction for reinforcement learning.

This module provides the Environment base class that defines the core interface
for reinforcement learning environments in the Pacman domain. Key functionality:

- State management and transitions
- Action space definition
- Reward signals
- Environment reset capability

The Environment class serves as an abstract interface that specific game 
environments must implement. It provides the essential methods needed for
agents to interact with and learn from the environment:

- getCurrentState: Get current environment state
- getPossibleActions: Get valid actions for a state  
- doAction: Execute action and get reward/next state
- reset: Reset environment to initial state

Most code originally by Dan Klein and John Denero for CS188 at UC Berkeley.
