"""
Q-learning agents for reinforcement learning in Pacman.

This module implements Q-learning agents that learn optimal policies through
experience in the Pacman environment. It includes tabular Q-learning and
approximate Q-learning with feature-based representations. The agents use
epsilon-greedy exploration and temporal difference learning to update Q-values.

Classes:
    QLearningAgent: Base tabular Q-learning implementation
    PacmanQAgent: Q-learning agent adapted for Pacman
    ApproximateQAgent: Q-learning with feature approximation

Functions:
    None

class QLearningAgent(ReinforcementAgent):

    Q-Learning Agent that learns through experience.

    This agent implements the Q-learning algorithm to learn optimal action values
    through exploration and exploitation. It maintains Q-values for state-action pairs
    and updates them based on received rewards and future value estimates.

    Key Functions:
        - computeValueFromQValues: Computes maximum Q-value for a state
        - computeActionFromQValues: Determines best action based on Q-values
        - getQValue: Retrieves Q-value for a state-action pair
        - getAction: Selects action using epsilon-greedy policy
        - update: Updates Q-values based on experience

    Instance Variables:
        - self.epsilon: Exploration probability
        - self.alpha: Learning rate
        - self.discount: Discount factor for future rewards
