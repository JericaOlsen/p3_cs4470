"""
Pacman agent implementations for Berkeley AI project.

This module provides different Pacman agent implementations including a left-turn
agent and a greedy agent. The agents demonstrate different movement strategies
and decision-making approaches in the Pacman environment.

Classes:
    LeftTurnAgent: Agent that prefers turning left when possible
    GreedyAgent: Agent that greedily selects highest-scoring moves

Functions:
    scoreEvaluation: Evaluates game state based on score

Python Version: 3.13
Last Modified: 24 Nov 2024
Modified by: George Rudolph

Changes:
- Added comprehensive module docstring
- Added class and function descriptions
- Added Python version compatibility note
- Added modifier attribution
- Verified Python 3.13 compatibility
- Added type hints
- Updated to use f-strings
